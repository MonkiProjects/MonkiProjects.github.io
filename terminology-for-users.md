# Terminology for users

## Places

Places are [spots](#spots) or [facilities](#facilities). They are located at an exact point, but can have more detailed components.

### Spots

## Maps

Maps are a small set of [places](#places).

## Folders

Folders are a way to group things together. You can share them with friends, publicly or keep them private.

## User

A user is basically someone who is using or used the app. To be clear about the vocabulary:

* A **visitor** is a user without an account.
* A **signed in user** is a user who created an account.
* A **former user** is a user who had an account, but deleted it.
* A **logged in user** is a signed in user currently using the app (right now).
* A **confirmed user** is a signed in user who confirmed their email address.
* A **verified user** is a confirmed user who confirmed their identity. It means we verified this person is real. It also means their username will be unavailable in the future.

## Groups

Groups allow you to share things more easily with other [users](#users). You can have plenty of groups, as you’d have tons of conversations on a messaging app. Creating groups allow you to give access to something to multiple [users](#users) at once instead of giving individual accesses manually. It also keeps accesses up to date, when someone joins or leaves the group.

> Groups doesn't have to be reflecting real-life [teams](#teams), you can organize them as you want!

## Teams

When we talk about teams, we really mean teams in real life, groups of people regularly training together.
