## Introduction

This feature refers to [Places](./feature-places.md), you should probably read it first.

## Feature description

Tracers usually share places between each other. It can be either beause they discovered
a new place or because they're out training and want to share their location.

## Technical specs

### A shared place should have a page on Monki Map's website

### Pages should be accessible by any browser with any Operating System

### Pages should not require logging in if the place is public

### Pages should have Open Graph meta tags

[Open Graph](https://www.opengraph.xyz)

### Pages should redirect to the Monki Map app if it's installed

### Pages should propose the user to download the Monki Map app if it's not installed

## Ideas

### Pages could have a navigation button that opens the user's preferred navigation app
